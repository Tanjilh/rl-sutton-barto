Exercise 3.14 Draw or describe the optimal state-value function for the golf
example

the optimal state value function consists of the probability of 
selecting the max action from the tee, the driver, multiplied by
the initial reward followed by some discount value multiplied by
the optimal next action, in this case the driver again, iteratovely 
continuing this process until the episode terminates which would
be to finally use the putter to reach the hole.

(based on feedback)

optimal state value function is defined by:

V*(s) = max_a(sum_s'(sum_r(p(s',r|s,a)[r+yV*(s')])))

possible choices of actions are driver or putter, depending on the position
of the balls state we want to pick action accordingly to get to the hole
in the least possible amount of steps

V*(s) is higher the closer it is to finishing, the longer you take to terminate
the lower the score becomes due to the negative reward of being anywhere other than the 
hole.

the reward function G_t = -1 -y -y^2 -... - Y^n-1

where n is the amount of swings it takes to get to the hole

so assuming the enviroment is deterministic for simplicity p(s′,r∣s,a)=1

V*(s) = -1 -y -y^2 -... - Y^n-1
      = -(1-y^n)/(1-y) [using geometric series]

and if y = 1 (undiscounted)

V*(s) = -n

this is because we consider the task episodic in this case and consider
each swing as reward of -1 so n is just the amount of swings it takes
to terminate the episode.
