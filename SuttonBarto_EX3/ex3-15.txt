Exercise 3.15 Draw or describe the contours of the optimal action-value
function for putting, q∗(s, putter), for the golf example.

optimal action value for the putter would take 6 swings to terminate

so assuming the enviroment is deterministic for simplicity p(s′,r∣s,a)=1

q∗(s, putter) = R_t+1 + yR_t+2 + y^2R_t+3 + ...

reward at each time other than termination is -1 and 0<=y<1 :

q∗(s, putter) = -1 - y - y^2 -y^3 -...-y^5
              =-(1-y^6)/(1-y)
