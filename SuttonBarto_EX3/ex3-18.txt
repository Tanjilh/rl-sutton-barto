Exercise 3.18 Give a definition of v∗ in terms of q∗.

V*(s) =  sum_s'(sum_r(p(s',r | s, a)*[R_t+1 + y * V*π(s')]))

since we are deterministically choosing the max action policy
by definition optimal state value function is the optimal state action function.

V*(s) = max_a(q*(s,a))

the bellman optimality equation

q*(s,a) = Exp(R_t+1 + Y * V*(S_t+1) | S_t = s ,A_t = a)
        = sum_s'(sum_r(p(s',r | s, a)*[R_t+1 + y * V*π(s')]))


intuition:

Vπ(S) = sum_a(π(s|a) * qπ(s,a))

action value is like asking how will my quality of life be given i 
go to a certain city (state) with this job (action)

state value is like asking how good will my quality of life be given
i am at this city (state)
