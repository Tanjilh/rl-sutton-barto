Exercise 3.20 Give a definition of π∗ in terms of q∗.


policy interms of q(s,a)

in greedy terms the model is deterministic 

π(a|s) = argmax_a(q(s,a))

or interms of a stochastic model:

π(a|s) = softmax(q(s,a))

so for the optimal policy

π*(a|s) = argmax_a(q*(s,a))

in a stochastic model with multiple optimal actions

π*(a|s) = softmax(q*(s,a))
