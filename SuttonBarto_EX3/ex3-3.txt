Exercise 3.3 Consider the problem of driving. You could define the actions
in terms of the accelerator, steering wheel, and brake, that is, where your
body meets the machine. Or you could define them farther out—say, where
the rubber meets the road, considering your actions to be tire torques. Or
you could define them farther in—say, where your brain meets your body, the
actions being muscle twitches to control your limbs. Or you could go to a
really high level and say that your actions are your choices of where to drive.
What is the right level, the right place to draw the line between agent and
environment? On what basis is one location of the line to be preferred over
another? Is there any fundamental reason for preferring one location over
another, or is it a free choice?


i think it can be free of choice but generally speaking we should consider at what point
is it easiest to observe these features, is it realistic to monitor muscle twitches while
someones driving, or is it easier to just monitor the accelerator, steering wheel and brake
as ultimately i believe that all these things are unified in their response to what will
happen on the road. for example the muscle twitch will influence directly what happens to
the steering wheel or break at a higher level but ultimately it has to go through the chain
of events such to actually move wheel or push down the accelerator to influence the car, hence
it seems unnecessary to observe at such a high level.

response (based on feedback)

frame the reasoning as a bias-variance trade-off:
i.e 
lower level actions (muscle twitches) - will be more in depth but harder to model or control

higher level actions (driving to a store) - is more easier to specify but stray away too much
to be directly actionable

outline that the purpose of modelling is to make learning or planning more feasible
