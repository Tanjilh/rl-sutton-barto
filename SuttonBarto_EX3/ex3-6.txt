Exercise 3.6: Broken Vision System Imagine that you are a vision
system. When you are first turned on for the day, an image floods into your
camera. You can see lots of things, but not all things. You can’t see objects
that are occluded, and of course you can’t see objects that are behind you.
After seeing that first scene, do you have access to the Markov state of the
environment? Suppose your camera was broken that day and you received no images 
at all, all day. Would you have access to the Markov state then?

a markovian state would imply that all future states are only dependant on the previous
time step state. in this case since we have an accesible state we would have access to the
next markovian state enviroment.

in the case where the camera is broken since we do not have access to the current day,
assuming the camera was working before we can access higher order markovian state enviroments

answer (based on feedback)

understand what a markovian state implies:
A Markov state is a representation that contains all the information necessary to predict future 
dynamics and rewards

P(sₜ₊₁ | sₜ, aₜ) = P(sₜ₊₁ | s₀, a₀, ..., sₜ, aₜ)

this means the current state alone is enough to capture the whole enviroment

in our scenario the state actually not truly markovian as many aspects of the enviroment
are hidden or not available through our current state

-The image may be partial: some objects are hidden, occluded, or behind you.
-You don’t see the full environment state, so you can’t fully predict what will happen next 
just from the current image.

so we dont have acesss to the markov state as the observation is partial
(unless augmented with memory via RNN or belief state)

if the camera is broken we are blind in the current state so we have even less access
to a markov state due to uncertainty

even with prior belief we cant formulate a belief on whats currently happening
